// Context API Learning Summary
// - In the typical React app state is passed down parent to child via props, but this prop drilling can become very tedious when many components need those props across the application
// - With the use of the "Context API" I no longer have conduct prop drilling across large scale applications
// - Using the Context API I can store the data within a context object, and retrieve that data in the necessary components from the Context API not props

// Module Learning Objectives
// - Define the problem the context API sloves, and how it solves it
// - Using a context provider, I will provide data to the component tree
// - I will need to consume data using the context object from within nested components
